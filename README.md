Hello World, 
<br/>
this a very basic boilerplate for **React** (frontend) and **Express** (backend).

### Installation
First clone the repo using command
```
git clone https://github.com/Txreq/expreact my-website
cd my-website
```

Then install dependencies 
```
npm install
npm run client-install
```
Now we are good to go, run local server with
`npm start`

And you should see this on http://localhost:3000/
